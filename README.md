Erenshor Clean Hotbars Mod

This is my first mod ever.
It removes the big hotbars numbers when no skill/item is assigned.
It's a simple mod I made for myself with the intention of learning.

## How to install

BepInEx plugin required: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx


1. Copy the compiled DLL into BepInEx plugins folder.
2. Run the game and the mod will automatically clean the hotbar numbers.

Currently the mod is not removing the numbers from the base game secondary hotbar and from Mizuki's Extended Hotbars mod.
I'm working on it.
