Erenshor Clean Hotbars Mod

This is my first mod ever.
It removes the big hotbars numbers when no skill/item is assigned.
It's a simple mod I made for myself with the intention of learning. This is a pre release.

Before:

## How to install

BepInEx plugin required: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx

1. Download the mod [from here](https://github.com/lucas-xk/Erenshor-Clean-Hotbars/releases)
2. Copy the compiled DLL into BepInEx plugins folder.
3. Run the game and the mod will automatically clean the hotbar numbers.

For the mod to take effect to the secondary hotbar, one must change to it within 5 seconds after entering the game, or just change zones while it's active.

Now it's working on Mizuki's [Extended Hotbars](https://github.com/MizukiBelhi/Erenshor-ExtendedHotbars/releases/tag/1.0.1) mod!

NOTE: When you press the Extended Hotbars hotkey to extend it, a small stuttering may occur, but only for that frame. It's almost imperceptible, and considering that we don't need to keep extending the hotbars during gameplay, it's not a big deal. Since the Extended Hotbars mod saves its state (whether it's extended or not), you probably won't see this. But if I can, I'll improve the code to mitigate this.

NOTE2: When using the second hotbar (from the base game) the Extended Hotbars mod won't show its hotkeys. So it's better to use the ones from Extended Hotbars mod (alt+1 or 2 by default) instead of the one from the base game.
