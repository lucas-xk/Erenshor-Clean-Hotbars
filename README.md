Erenshor Clean Hotbars Mod

This is my first mod ever.
It removes the big hotbars numbers when no skill/item is assigned.
It's a simple mod I made for myself with the intention of learning. This is a pre release.

Before:

## How to install

BepInEx plugin required: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx

1. Download the mod [from here](https://github.com/lucas-xk/Erenshor-Clean-Hotbars/releases)
2. Copy the compiled DLL into BepInEx plugins folder.
3. Run the game and the mod will automatically clean the hotbar numbers.

For the mod to take effect to the secondary hotbar, one must change to it within 5 seconds after entering the game, or just change zones while it's active.

Currently the mod is not removing the numbers from Mizuki's Extended Hotbars mod.
I'm working on it.
